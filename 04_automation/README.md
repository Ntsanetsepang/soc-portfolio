# Security Automation

This directory contains security automation scripts and tools that demonstrate programming skills applied to security operations tasks.

## Contents

- [Log Parser](./parse_logs.py): A Python script for parsing and analyzing security logs
- [Requirements](./requirements.txt): Python dependencies required for the automation scripts

## Purpose

These automation tools are designed to streamline security operations tasks, including:

- Log parsing and normalization
- Threat detection
- Alert enrichment
- Data visualization
- Reporting

## Usage

### Log Parser

The log parser script can process various log formats and extract relevant security information. It supports:

- Windows Event Logs
- Syslog
- Web server logs
- Custom log formats

To use the log parser:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the parser on a log file
python parse_logs.py --input /path/to/logfile --format windows --output results.json
```

## Development Approach

These automation tools follow best practices for security-focused development:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging
- Modular design for extensibility
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Comprehensive documentation

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for these automation tools include:

- Support for additional log formats
- Integration with SIEM platforms via APIs
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Dashboard visualization

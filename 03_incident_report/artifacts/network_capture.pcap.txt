# Network Capture Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for a network capture (PCAP) file that would contain sanitized network traffic related to the incident.

In a real portfolio, this would be a sanitized PCAP file showing relevant network traffic from the incident, with sensitive information removed.

Example information that might be included in an actual PCAP:
- C2 traffic patterns
- Beaconing activity
- HTTP/HTTPS requests to malicious domains
- DNS queries to malicious domains
- Data exfiltration attempts (sanitized)

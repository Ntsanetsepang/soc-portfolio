# Malware Analysis Screenshot Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for a screenshot that would show malware analysis results.

In a real portfolio, this would be a sanitized screenshot showing:
- Malware analysis sandbox results
- Memory forensics output
- Command and control traffic patterns
- Malicious code snippets with analysis annotations

Note: Actual screenshots would be PNG or JPG files, but this text file serves as a placeholder.

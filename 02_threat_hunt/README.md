# Threat Hunting

This directory contains threat hunting methodologies, hypotheses, and analysis notebooks that demonstrate proactive threat hunting capabilities.

## Contents

- [Hunts Documentation](./hunts.md): Detailed documentation of threat hunting hypotheses, data sources, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings
- [Jupyter Notebook](./jupyter_notebook.ipynb): Analysis notebook with Python code for data processing and visualization

## Threat Hunting Methodology

The threat hunting process followed in these examples includes:

1. **Hypothesis Formation**: Developing a hypothesis based on threat intelligence, known TTPs, or anomalous behavior
2. **Data Collection**: Identifying and gathering relevant data sources
3. **Analysis**: Processing and analyzing the data to validate or refute the hypothesis
4. **Documentation**: Recording findings, whether positive or negative
5. **Refinement**: Refining the hypothesis and analysis techniques based on findings

## Tools and Techniques

These hunts utilize various tools and techniques, including:

- Python data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical analysis for anomaly detection
- Log parsing and normalization
- Timeline analysis

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Each hunt is mapped to relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques to provide context and ensure comprehensive coverage of the threat landscape.
